            <li class="font-semibold text-2xl text-sky-700">1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</li>
            <p class="font-semibold py-2">Ans: The Document Object Model, DOM
                The Document Object Model is a standard set by W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium. This standard defines how web browsers load and interpret HTML and XML documents.
                
                In this standard, HTML elements are interpreted as objects with specific attributes. In the DOM, these objects are referred to as nodes.
                
                Purpose:
                According to the W3C, one of the main reasons for developing the DOM is to maintain a standard programming interface for HTML and XML documents, which is language-independent. Setting and maintaining this standard enables programmers to create or navigate these types of documents and modify their elements predictably, using any type of language or development environment.
                
                Having said that, JavaScript language is arguably one of the most popular ways of working with HTML documents using the DOM.</p>
            <li class="font-semibold text-2xl text-sky-700">2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM
                methods.</li>
            <p class="font-semibold py-2">Ans: We can select dom in various way. There are five common ways to select dom
                :
            <ul>
                <li>1. getElementById()</li>
                <li>2. getElementByClassName()</li>
                <li>3.getElementByTagName()</li>
                <li>4.querySelector()</li>
                <li>5.querySelectorAll()</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <li class="font-semibold text-2xl text-sky-700">3. What is event bubble?
            </li>
            <p class="font-semibold py-2">Ans: Bubble is a most important things in Dom. It happens when elements clicked or when an elements receive a events  and bubble propagate to its parent. And it's propagate until it get to the root element.</p>
            <li class="font-semibold text-2xl text-sky-700">4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?
            </li>
            <p class="font-semibold py-2">Ans: A callback function is any reference to executable code that is passed as an argument to another piece of code. When we need to use one function to execute only after another function has completed execution then we use call back function. We can use this in Javascript</p>
